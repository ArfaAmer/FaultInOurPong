\section {Team Meeting Plan} 

Team members will be meeting on a daily basis. Two types of meeting will be utilized: the face-to-face meeting and the on-line meeting. The meetings are scheduled based on team members' course schedules and their availabilities. The on-line meeting plan is listed in the following section, and the face-to-face meeting plan is described below.\\

Rules for agenda & If anyone cannot attend a pre-scheduled meeting, he/she should notify the team at least 3 hours before so the meeting can be rescheduled and must bring food to the next meeting. Each team member should be prepared for the meeting, so that during the meeting, each member would show what they have done since the last meeting, any problems encountered during the project work, and any plans that should be finished before next meeting.  \\ \hline

\section {Team Communication Plan} 

In addition to meeting face-to-face, team members also agreed to share their personal contact for on-line meeting. Several on-line applications will be utilized for contacts, discussions, and file-sharing.

\section  {Team Member Roles}

Each team member is assigned at least one roles for this project. The team leader will be in charge of the project as a whole, including guiding the members in the progress of development, delegating tasks to members properly, and maintaining healthy group dynamics. An expert on technology will be focusing on the software development of the project, and he/she will be helping other team members on programming problems/issues. A documentation expert will be managing the tasks on documentations, and ensuring the good quality of the documentations at submissions.\\

\end{tabular}

\section  { Git Workflow Plan}

The centralized flow plan will be used on Git. A master branch is created on GitLab for file sharing and submissions. When working on the project, each team members will be pulling or committing files from the master branch. The commits will be identified by Mac IDs and commit messages. Labels are considered as tags for the submissions. At the end of the semester, this project will be submitted as a milestone.\\

\section  {Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

Testing will be difficult because it is a game and self testing could turn out to be a challenge - we can change the parameters (values and data) in the model part of the program. For example to see if the counting of score is taking place properly we can program it in the model in such a way that if a user misses the pong in the first turn, we can use assert statements to check if the miss has been recorded as it was implemented to be.\\

For the implementation of the game we are planning to add a multi-player option, so that could turn out to be a challenge - multi-player mode can require the use of threads, we are doing a course called concurrency and are moving forward with the course along with the project so they should complement each other.\\

The required library is not a challenge.

\end{tabular}

For the game to work one will require a Java environment (JRE), which could be a challenge for the intended users. Team members will try to create an android friendly version of the game (this part of the implementation may be scheduled after the end of the course because of time restrains). \\

\section {Coding Style}
The Google Java Style will be the guide for this project. To be precise, the codes will adhere the Google Java Style in terms of its the format, class structures, naming conventions, and any other features pointed out in the guide.\\
