\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}
Our project passed all the nonfunctional requirements detailed below, hence our project is adequate, in the fields that are tested below.

\subsection {Usability}
Test Name: FN-1: This testing is done to ensure that the re-designing of the game has made the game better than it was originally. \par
Test Method: Survey \par
Result: A survey was conducted; the users were asked if the redesigned version of the game was better than the original version of the game. All the users that took part in the survey answered that the redesigned game is better than the original game. Hence, this test has been completed successfully. \par

\vspace{5mm}


Test Name: FN-2: Test to conﬁrm that the game runs in all major operating systems such as Windows, Mac OX, Linux etc. \par
Test Method: Running the game in various operating systems \par
Result: The game was run in various operating systems and it compiled and run in each of the platform. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\subsection {Spelling and Grammar}
Test Name: FN-3: Making sure that the game does not have any grammar or spelling errors. \par
Test Method: Proofreading documents and the game display \par
Result: The folders within the game and the documents relating to it were checked for grammar and spelling errors during revision 1 to ensure the competence of this test. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\subsection {Hardware requirement}
Test Name: FN-4: Making sure that the speed of game doesn’t change in diﬀerent machines. \par
Test Method: Running the game in various computers and finding the speed of the ball in each machine. \par
Result: The game does not have tangible speed difference when it runs if various computers. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\subsection { Entertainment}
Test Name: FN-5: This testing is done to determine if the game is entertaining enough for the user. \par
Test Method: Survey \par
Result: Users rated the game as entertaining and more than 50 percent of the users were willing to play the game again. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\subsection {Challenge}
Test Name: FN-6: Test done to determine if the game is challenging enough for the user. \par
Test method: Survey \par
Result: The testing group played the game and around 60 percent of the users rated the game as easy and 40 percent of the users rated the game as medium. A medium means that the game isn’t too hard but isn’t so easy that it gets boring. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\subsection { Controls}
Test Name: FN-7: Test done to determine if the game controls are intuitive. \par
Test method: survey \par
Result: The testing group was asked if it is easy to play and run the game. All the participates of the survey replied this question with very easy. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\subsection {Robustness and Performance}
Test Name: FN-8: Test done to estimate Robustness and Performance. \par
Test Method: Manually browsing through the various states in the game \par
Result: The game was loaded and played 15 times. In this duration the game didn’t crash a single time and the level of performance was never undermined. \par

\vspace{5mm}


\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation} 
The nonfunctional requirement evaluation (FN-1) was done to ensure that the reconstruction of the game made it better among the user than it was originally. The users were asked if the redesigned version of the game was better than the original version of the game. All the users that took part in the survey answered that the redesigned game is better than the original game. Hence, this test ensured that the redesigned version of the game is better than the original. 

\section{Unit Testing}
Junit was used to conduct the Unit testing. After rigorously testing the software, the various units that were tested yielded expected results. A full detail on the test cases that were performed can be viewed by accessing the j-unit test files that is compiled under the source folder with other java implementation code for this project.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
During the testing phase of the project, the survey showed that due to lack of portability many of the users were not as willing to play or download our game. When we did the survey, we had not created a java jar file. This led us to problem as people without a java running environment did not want to download a java running environment just to play the game. Thus, after the survey data were evaluated our team decided to create a jar file to increase the portability of the project.

\section{Automated Testing}
Test Name: PC-1: Checking to see that the game sets score correctly. \par
Method: A new game state was created and the score at the beginning of the game is returned for both the user and the player. Then the results are evaluated to see that it matches the expected result. The unit test units: testSetTopScore() and testSetButtomScore() were used to perform this test. \par
Initial input: 10 \par
Output: 10 \par
Result: Pass. \par

\vspace{5mm}


Test name: PC-4: Checking to see that the position of the ball is set properly. \par
Method: A new game state is created and the position of the ball at the beginning of the game is returned and compared with the expected position of the ball. \par
Initial input: position of the ball from the game. \par
Output: (x,y) = (20,20) \par
Result: Pass. \par

\vspace{5mm}


Test name: PC-5: Checking to see that the potion of the paddle is set properly. \par
Method: A new game state is created and the position of the paddle at the beginning of the game is returned and compared with the expected position of the paddle. \par
Initial input: position of the paddle from the game. \par
Output: (x,y) = (20,20) \par
Result: Pass. \par

\section{Trace to Requirements}
\section{Trace to Modules} 

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
Our group has managed to produce roughly 70 percent code coverage. Through j-unit test we have covered most of the modules in testing units. Also survey has helped us test most of the nonfunctional requirements.
