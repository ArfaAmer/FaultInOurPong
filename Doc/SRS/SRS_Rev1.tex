	\section{Project Drivers}
	\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
	We have overtaken this project to improve the electronic version of ping pong game we found in an open source \textcolor{red}{project on the Git website}. The use of \textcolor{red}{computers and other electronic devices} for entertainment has been growing for several years now. The electronic version of the ping pong game used to be automatically installed with the installation of new windows. But for some years now Microsoft has stopped adding this game to the windows operating system. While, there are variations of this game available for download in the \textcolor{red}{App} store, there is still a market for \textcolor{red}{new and improved ping pong games. Our game} provides the players with a slightly challenging game that does not require any tools other than a computer that has a \textcolor{red}{Java} running environment. This game can be played among friends to relieve themselves of boredom. This project will also provide the users with a game that can be played by people of any age group. \\

	
	\subsection{The Stakeholders}
	\subsubsection{The Client}
	An external entity is regarded the client for this project. This entity is interested in the redevelopment of the project. Though this project is very open ended and can be \textcolor{red}{further} developed in endless manners, there still are some restrictions that \textcolor{red}{have} been applied on the manner of development. This restrictions, in regards to the development has been applied by the 3XA3 team\textcolor{red}{ (3XA3 team defined in Table 2 of Section 1.4)}, and thus can be looked upon as the client figure.\\
			
	\subsubsection{The Customers}
	Any person with an access to a computer that has a \textcolor{red}{Java} running environment can be considered as a customer for this project. As this game does not have restrictions in terms of age, gender or any other socio-economic factor, everyone can be considered as the customer of this project.\\

	\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
	We are also the stakeholders for this project, as the development of this project and its result would be a great effect upon us. The general public can also be considered as the stakeholders as through them we are to gain customer base for our game. \textcolor{red}{The rules and regulations of the redevelopment process have been set by the professor and the TAs, so they are also considered as stakeholders.}
	
	\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Description:} The project is being developed in \textcolor{red}{Java} language in \textcolor{red}{Eclipse} and \textcolor{red}{has to be run in a Java running environment}.\\	
	\textbf{Rationale:} Java running environments such as \textcolor{red}{Eclipse} are available online for free for users and thus can be downloaded by any user intending to play the game.\\	
	\textbf{Fit Criterion:} There shall be a link provided with the release of this game to download a \textcolor{red}{Java} running environment, for users that do not have it already.\\
	\item\textbf{Description:} The project is provided online, in an open source environment, for anyone who wants to use it. Internet connection would be required to download the game the first time \textcolor{red}{the player uses it}.\\	
	\textbf{Rationale:} The user should be connected to the internet that can assure the downloading of the game.\\	
	\textbf{Fit Criterion:} As the game only needs to be downloaded once for the user, it isnâ€™t very hard to accomplish. It only needs to be downloaded once and can be enjoyed for as long as the user intends to use it.

	\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
	\textbf{Facts:} There will be approximately 1000 lines of codes for this game by the time this game is completed. The original \textcolor{red}{code} of the game that is being reconstructed can be found in https://github.com/mihneadb/Pong.\\  

	\textbf{Assumptions:} It is assumed that the user will have some access to the internet to download the codes that will be used to run this game when the user wishes to play this game for the first time. It is also assumed that the person will either have access to a \textcolor{red}{Java} running environment or be willing to download a \textcolor{red}{Java} running environment. Since internet is readily accessible this should not be much of a trifle.

	
	\section{Functional Requirements}

	\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
The developers would rewrite the code into a structured design. By doing this, the work for future maintenance would be easier.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{ContextDiagram.png}
  \caption{Context Diagram for the Game}
\end{figure}

	\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
The software application to be developed will follow the same game rules as the original Pong game application\textcolor{red}{, with the exception of the bomb mode. Bomb mode will have a second red-coloured ball; a bomb, which the players have to miss while not missing the original black ball at the same time.} The interface of the new application would \textcolor{red}{also be improved. There will be additional features added through an in-game options panel. Additionally, the player will be given lives so that there will be a specific termination to the game. Along with the lives, at the end of each game, the player will also be notified of the amount of time they have played.}
	\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}
	The Pong project will be following a model similar to the Water Flow development process. The project will start with developing a problem statement for the new project. It can help team-mates clarify the objective of the work, such as what to improve on the Pong game, and how much we can improve. Team-mates then would like to create a development plan for the Pong game, to make sure each development process is on track and on time. A requirement specification plan is then created to further break down the project into smaller tasks. This include specifying the requirements for the new software, stating the personnel that is related to this Pong project, and clarifying any concerns and issue related to it. A Verification and Validation Plan would be created in the following, to give team members and other stakeholders a vague idea of what the final product would be. Design Specification Document would be formulated for better clarifications before application implementation. Team-mates would be coding following all the documents mentioned, and the Verification and Validation Plan will test the program when it is completed.\\

	The team of three will be working on the redevelopment of the project. Each team member will be assigned different tasks to work on the project. A Gantt Chart will be used to keep track of working activities for each member in the team, that means each member would have to make a mark on the Gantt Chart when they complete a task. \\

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
So far there arenâ€™t any open issues.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
The game that this project is attempting to reconstruct would act as an initial model for this project that we have overtaken. There are also other similar games available and the way certain parts are executed can provide a model for us to base our design on. There are also guidance and directions available in \textcolor{red}{Java} tutorial sites for any programming problems that are likely to occur during the development of this game.  
\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Problems in the Current Environment}
None applicable in the project.
\subsubsection{Existing User}
Is there a way to clear user record?
\subsubsection{Limitations in Implementation Environment} 
Is it possible to run on every device that has Java?

\subsection{Risks}
There are no risks associated with this project.
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The user documents will be created as per the SE 3XA3 guidelines.
There will be an in-game tutorial that will display the instructions on how to play the game. Other than that, no further training should be required..
\subsection{Waiting Room}
There are many factors in the game that has to be improved upon, as has been discussed throughout various parts in the document. The improvement of functionality of the game is to be looked forward towards. The addition of sound to the game can also be added to this.
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Proper documentations for the game must be made. The coding for the game should be well commented and easy to follow. Other then this, for the current period there isnâ€™t any other ideas for solutions. This section would be updated at a later period.
