	\section{Project Drivers}
	\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
	We have overtaken this project to improve the electronic version of ping pong game we found in an open source projects in git website. The use of computer and any other electronics for entertainment has been growing for several years now. The electronic version of the ping pong game used to be automatically installed with the installation of new windows. But for some years now Microsoft has stopped adding this game to the windows operating system. While, there are variations of this game available for download in the app store, there is still a market for a multi-player ping pong game for entertainment purposes. The game can also be enjoyed individually. It provides the players with a slightly challenging game that does not require any tools other than a computer that has a java running environment. This game can be played among friends to relieve themselves of boredom. This project will also provide the users with a game that can be played by people of any age group. \\
	
	\subsection{The Stakeholders}
	\subsubsection{The Client}
	An external entity is regarded the client for this project. This entity is interested in the redevelopment of the project. Though this project is very open ended and can be developed in endless manners, there still are some restrictions that has been applied on the manner of development. This restrictions, in regards to the development has been applied by the 3XA3 team, and thus can be looked upon as the client figure.\\
			
	\subsubsection{The Customers}
	Any person with an access to a computer that has a java running environment can be considered as a costumer for this project. As this game does not have restrictions in terms of age, gender or any other socio-economic factor, everyone can be considered as the customer of this project.\\
	\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
	We are also the stakeholders for this project, as the development of this project and its result would be a great effect upon us. The general public can also be considered as the stakeholders as through them we are to gain customer base for our game.
	
	\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
	Description: The project is being developed in java language in eclipse and is run in java running environments.
Rationale: Java running environments such as eclipse are available online for free for users and thus can be downloaded by any user intending to play the game.
Fit Criterion: There shall be a link provided with the release of this game to download a java running environment, for users that do not have it already.\\
\noindent Description: The project is provided online, in an open source environment, for anyone who wants to use it. Internet connection would be required to download the game the first time the user wants to use it.
Rationale: The user should be connected to the internet that can assure the downloading of the game.
Fit Criterion: As the game only needs to be downloaded once for the user it isn’t very hard to accomplish. It only needs to be downloaded once and can be enjoyed for as long as the user intends to use it.

	\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
Facts:
There will be approximately 1000 lines of codes for this game by the time this game is completed. The original of the game that is being reconstructed can be found in https://github.com/mihneadb/Pong.\\  
\noindent Assumptions:
It is assumed that the user will have some access to the internet to download the codes that will be used to run this game when the user wishes to play this game for the first time. It is also assumed that the person will either have access to a java running environment or be willing to download a java running environment. Since internet is readily accessible this should not be much of a trifle.
	
	\section{Functional Requirements}
	\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
The developers would rewrite the code into a structured design. By doing this, the work for future maintenance would be easier.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{ContextDiagram.png}
  \caption{Context Diagram for the Game}
\end{figure}
	\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
The software application to be developed will follow the same game rules as the original Pong game application. The interface of the new application would be better than the original game. The winning and losing would be better indicated on the screen.
	\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}
	The Pong project will be following a model similar to the \st{V-Model} Water Flow development process. The project will start with developing a problem statement for the new project. It can help team-mates clarify the objective of the work, such as what to improve on the Pong game, and how much we can improve. Team-mates then would like to create a development plan for the Pong game, to make sure each development process is on track and on time. A requirement specification plan is then created to further break down the project into small tasks. This include specifying the requirements for the new software, stating the personnel that is related to this Pong project, and clarifying any concerns and issue related to it. Verification and Validation Plan would be created in the following, to give team members and other stakeholders a vague idea of what the final product would be. Design Specification Document would be formulated for better clarifications before application implementation. Team-mates would be coding following all the documents mentioned, and Verification and Validation Plan will test the program when it is completed.\\
\noindent The team of three will be working on the redevelopment of the project. Each team member will be assigned different tasks to work on the project. A Gantt Chart will be used to keep track of working activities for each member in the team, that means each member would have to make a mark on the Gantt Chart when they complete a task. \\
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}
	Case: User performs mouse click on the Start button
Result: The program would start the game and the game scene would be displayed.\\
Case: User performs mouse click on the Restart button
Result: The program would reset the game results and it would display the initial game scene.\\
Case: User performs mouse click on the Save button
Result:  The program would save the players’ record, but the game continues. \\
Case: User performs mouse click on the Tutorial button
Result: The program would display a description of the game and teach the user how to play it.\\
Case: User performs mouse click on the Close button
Result: The program game would stop, the window of the application would be closed, and the current game result would not be saved.\\
Case: User taps on UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT on the keyboard.
Result: The player would be able to move his/her game board.\\

\section{Project Issues}
\subsection{Open Issues}
So far there aren’t any open issues.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
The game that this project is attempting to reconstruct would act as an initial model for this project that we have overtaken. There are also other similar games available and the way certain parts are executed can provide a model for us to base our design on. There are also guidance and directions available in java tutorial sites for any programming problems that are likely to occur during the development of this game.  
\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Problems in the Current Environment}
None applicable in the project.
\subsubsection{Existing User}
Is there a way to clear user record?
\subsubsection{Limitations in Implementation Environment} 
Is it possible to run on every device that has Java?
\subsection{Tasks}
Tasks Deadline
Model Development October 14
View Development October 14
Control Development October 17
Project Revision October 31
Project Improvement November 19
\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
None applicable in the project.
\subsection{Risks}
There are no risks associated with this project.
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The user documents will be created as per the SE 3XA3 guidelines.
There will be an in-game tutorial that will display the instructions on how to play the game. Other than that, no further training should be required..
\subsection{Waiting Room}
There are many factors in the game that has to be improved upon, as has been discussed throughout various parts in the document. The improvement of functionality of the game is to be looked forward towards. The addition of sound to the game can also be added to this.
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Proper documentations for the game must be made. The coding for the game should be well commented and easy to follow. Other then this, for the current period there isn’t any other ideas for solutions. This section would be updated at a later period.
